# Convert-Integer-to-Roman-Numeral-Part-II
This algorithm is a prototype for printing the roman numerals. This program takes the integer input from user and stores it as an array and afterwards prints the ASCII value of each integer in that string in reverse. 

The purpose of this is to account for the odd manner numbers penultimate to factors of 10 operate with the Roman script as well as before numbers penultimate to factors of five.
The goal after this prototype is to print appropriate values that account for your IVs and your IXs. The succeeding project will print the correct numerals by proessing ASCII values of integer per string.
